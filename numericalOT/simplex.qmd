### What is the simplex for?

The simplex algorithm solves linear problems in their *standard form*, *i.e.*, the following type of optimization problems:
\begin{align}
    \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \; & c^T x
    \\
    \text{s.t.} \; & A x = b
    \\
    & x \geq 0 \enspace,
\end{align}
where $c \in \mathbb{R}^n$,
$b \in \mathbb{R}^m$,
and
$A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$.
